<Info>
	**Prerequisite**: You must have a React project initialized and zod
	installed on it to use Zodaf.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Zodaf on your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @zodaf/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm i @zodaf/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @zodaf/react
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. To initialize Zodaf configuration, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx @zodaf/react init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @zodaf/react init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @zodaf/react init
```

</CodeGroup>
Your project can now use `Zodaf`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
	Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
	Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:
